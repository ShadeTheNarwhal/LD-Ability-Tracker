# LD-Ability-Tracker
Hello. My name is ShadeTheNarwhal, I am a Moderator on both the LEGO Dimensions Wiki and the LEGO Dimensions Wiki Discord Server. And I am here to make it easier to keep track of the abilities of characters in LEGO Dimensions. As of July 18th, 2017, this tracker has been updated for Waves 1-8 of Years 1 and 2. This also includes Polybags.
In dedication to Skylanderlord3/Jason, a friend of mine who was in a car crash recently and may not live.
